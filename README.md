## 🧠 What’s Inside?

In this report, we explore and compare the most commonly used normalization methods, along with real-world numerical examples and visual explanations:

| 🔢 Method                     | 🧪 Description                                  |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Min-Max Scaling**          | Rescales features to a fixed range \[0, 1\]     |
| **Z-Score Standardization**  | Centers data to mean 0 and std 1               |
| **Decimal Scaling**          | Moves decimal points based on data magnitude   |
| **Log Scaling**              | Handles skewed data, compresses large ranges   |
| **Robust Scaling**           | Uses median and IQR, resistant to outliers     |
| **Max-Abs Scaling**          | Scales by maximum absolute value               |
| **L1 Normalization**         | Scales feature vector to unit L1 norm          |
| **L2 Normalization**         | Scales feature vector to unit L2 norm          |
| **Mean Normalization**       | Centers data around the mean                   |
